Crucials
==========
A plugin that offers crucial and helpful commands.
--------------------------------------------------

Crucials has unique features that make it different from any other plugin that helps server administrators. It offers extra commands like `/saveserver` (coming again soon) which saves your entire network to a repo of your choice.

Compiling from Source
------
To compile Crucials, you will need JDK <version> or later, an internet connection, and preferably an IDE (IntelliJ
is the best).

If you don't want to use an IDE, clone this repo and run `./gradlew build`. You can find the compiled jar in `build/libs`
as `Crucials-<version>.jar`. Otherwise, clone this repo, set up a project that uses existing resources, and add a configuration that runs `gradle build`.

Binaries
------
You can download the jar files in the releases tab if you don't want to compile Crucials from source. Keep in
mind, it usually won't be up-to-date with the latest commit.
